In USTC, I was lucky enough to be in the Prof. Zhengyuan Xu\u0026rsquo;s group and started my research in optical wireless communication field. My previous research experiences are somehow pretty wide: I spent the first one year focusing on physical layer of visible light communication and real-time communication system; then I tried to extend CNN object detection task to optical camera communication scenario and during this whole COVID-19 work-from-home period, I did some work of vision-based optical positioning.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://smileyzyw.github.io/author/yingwen-zhang-%E5%BC%A0%E9%A2%96%E6%96%87/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/yingwen-zhang-%E5%BC%A0%E9%A2%96%E6%96%87/","section":"authors","summary":"I am now a graduate student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and I received my undergraduate education at Harbin Engineering University (HEU), where I lay a solid foundation in wireless communication and signal processing-related areas, with both theoretical and practical ability.","tags":null,"title":"Yingwen Zhang (张颖文)","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Y.

We tried to utilize this kind of temporal feature to distinguish beacon LEDs from DC interferences and our solution is straight-forward: we first stacked multiple input frames into a RGB image that converts the temporal information of LEDs into the spatial information of image. Then, using the advanced CNN object detector, we can detect the beacon candidate region with a very high recall in this stacked RGB map. Finally, given the coarse position information, a demodulator was designed to determine the \u0026lsquo;0/1\u0026rsquo; state of LEDs and once beacons are coded with run-length coding, we can detect them robustly within 3 frames. Besides, we also proved that our detection framework can be easily generalized to inputs with more than 3 frames.
